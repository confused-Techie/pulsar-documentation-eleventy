Text selections in Pulsar support a number of actions, such as scoping deletion, indentation and search actions, and marking text for actions such as quoting and bracketing.

Selections mirror many of the movement commands. Theyâ€™re actually exactly the same keybindings as the movement commands, but with a [[Shift]] key added in.
