If you are having issues installing a package using `pulsar -p install`, this
could be because the package has dependencies on libraries that contain native
code. This means you will need to have a C++ compiler and Python installed to be
able to install it. You can run `pulsar -p install --check` to see if the Pulsar
package manager can build native code on your machine.

Check out the pre-requisites in the [build instructions](#requirements-and-dependencies)
for your platform for more details.
