## macOS error "_App is damaged and canâ€™t be opened_"

The binary is likely from before macOS binaries started being signed.
A up-to-date and signed binary may be downloaded from [the download page](/download.html).
The unsigned binary can be made to run by running
`xattr -cr /Applications/Pulsar.app/` in the terminal.
See [here](https://appletoolbox.com/app-is-damaged-cannot-be-opened-mac/) for
more information.

## Pulsar does not launch "_GPU process isn't usable. Goodbye_"

You may need to launch the application with the argument `--no-sandbox` to get
around this issue. This is something [under investigation](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/issues/174).
