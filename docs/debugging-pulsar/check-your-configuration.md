If you’re experiencing some unusual behavior or appearance, it’s possible that something in your own configuration files could be causing it. To find out for sure, you can take these steps:

* Quit Pulsar.
* Locate your Pulsar home folder and back up your keymap file, your init file, your config file, and your stylesheet. Then delete these files from your home folder.
* When you relaunch Pulsar, these files will be recreated.
* If the problem is still present, your configuration files are not the culprit. You can copy them back to their original locations.
