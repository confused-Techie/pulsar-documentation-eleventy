If you're experiencing performance problems in a particular situation, your [issue reports](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) will be more valuable if you include a saved profile from Chromeâ€™s CPU profiler that gives some insight into what is slow.

To run a profile, open the Developer Tools with <kbd class="platform-linux platform-win">Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd><kbd class="platform-mac">Alt+Cmd+I</kbd>. From there:

1. Click the _Profiles_ tab
2. Select "Collect JavaScript CPU Profile"
3. Click "Start"

Once that is done, then perform the slow action to capture a recording. When
finished, click "Stop". Switch to the "Chart" view, and a graph of the recorded
actions will appear. You can save and post the profile data by clicking "Save"
next to the profile's name in the left panel.
