You can split any editor pane horizontally or vertically by using <kbd class="platform-linux platform-win">Ctrl+K</kbd> <kbd class="platform-mac">Cmd+K</kbd> <kbd>Up/Down/Left/Right</kbd> where the direction key is the direction to split the pane. Once you have a split pane, you can switch between them with <span class="platform-linux platform-win"><kbd>Ctrl-K</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl+Up/Down/Left/Right</kbd></span> <span class="platform-mac"><kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> <kbd>Cmd+Up/Down/Left/Right</kbd></span> where the direction is the direction the focus should move to. These correspond to a number of commands that begin with **Pane:** and can be found in the command palette.

Each pane has its own “pane items,” and Pulsar represents them as tabs by default. You can move the files from pane to pane by dragging them with the mouse and dropping them in the pane you want that file to be in.

To close a pane, you can close all pane items with <kbd class="platform-linux platform-win">Ctrl+W</kbd> <kbd class="platform-mac">Cmd+W</kbd> (the **Core: Close** command). You can configure whether panes auto-close when empty in the Settings View with the **Remove Empty Panes** setting in the **Core** pane of the settings view.

::: tip Tip

If you don't like using tabs, you don't have to. You can disable the {tabs} package and each pane will still support multiple pane items. You just won't have tabs to use to click between them.
